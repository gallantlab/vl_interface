The code in this repository is associated with the paper:
[Visual and linguistic semantic representations are aligned at the border of human visual cortex](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00921-6)

This code went through a small amount of restructuring prior to publication. It is possible that not all pointers between functions are correct, but the computations within individual functions has not been altered.

(Note: Development of this code began in 2015, so it was written originally in python2. There are no guarantees that this will work in python3, so be aware that some alternations may need to be made at this time.)
